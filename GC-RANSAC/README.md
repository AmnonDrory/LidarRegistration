## GC-RANSAC Additions
This directory includes changes made to GC-RANSAC code as part of the experiments presented
in the paper "Stress Testing LiDAR Registration". The original GC-RANSAC code is available at:
https://github.com/danini/graph-cut-ransac
Our changes make it possible to use ELC (edge-length constraints) for quick rejection, and to disable local-optimization.
