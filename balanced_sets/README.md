## Balanced Registration Sets
This directory contains a listing of the selected pairs of point clouds, with their relative motions.
To load the point clouds themselves, the datasets need to be available, 
as well as any code packages needed for loading them. As an example of usage, see:
```
BalancedDatasetGenerator/datasets/ApolloSouthbay.py
Experiments/dataloader/balanced/ApolloSouthbay.py
